# 🎮 Guess The Number Game

A fun and interactive **Guess the Number** game built using **Java** and extended into a **modern browser-based arcade version** using **React**.  
This project demonstrates core programming logic, object-oriented principles, and real-world deployment.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the user must guess it within a limited number of attempts.  
After each guess, the system provides feedback indicating whether the guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**.  
A scoring mechanism rewards users based on the number of remaining attempts.
